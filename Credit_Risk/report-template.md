## Overview of the Analysis

This report presents a credit risk analysis conducted using machine learning models. The purpose of this analysis is to develop and evaluate predictive models for classifying credit applicants into two categories: 'healthy loans' (0) and 'high-risk loans' (1). By utilizing historical lending data, we aim to create models that assist in identifying potential high-risk loan applications, thus aiding the company's decision-making process.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Balanced Accuracy Score (Resampled): 0.994
Precision (Healthy Loan, 0): 1.00
Precision (High-Risk Loan, 1): 0.85
Recall (Healthy Loan, 0): 0.99
Recall (High-Risk Loan, 1): 0.99

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
The machine learning model, trained and evaluated on resampled data using Logistic Regression, demonstrates outstanding performance in credit risk analysis. The balanced accuracy score of approximately 0.994 indicates that the model can effectively classify both 'healthy loans' and 'high-risk loans'. Additionally, the precision and recall scores for both classes indicate a high degree of accuracy in identifying loan categories.

The model's exceptional precision (1.00) and recall (0.99) for 'healthy loans' suggest that it can reliably identify applicants with a low risk of default. Furthermore, its strong precision (0.85) and exceptional recall (0.99) for 'high-risk loans' demonstrate its ability to accurately identify potentially problematic loan applications.

Based on these results, we strongly recommend the usage of this Logistic Regression model for credit risk analysis. It strikes an excellent balance between precision and recall for both classes, showcasing its effectiveness in differentiating between safe and high-risk loan applications. Its high accuracy and reliability make it a valuable tool for supporting the company's lending decisions.
